          Hi everyone, my name is Diego Mendoza. I’m from a Nicaraguan background,
          and I speak both Spanish (native) and English (fluent). I enjoy working
          out, and I also like making video edits mostly using DaVinci Resolve,
          though sometimes CapCut. I’m definitely more of a night person, so if
          we’re hanging out, it’s probably going to be at night.
        </p>

            <strong>Courses I’m Taking & Why:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>CTCM 2530 – Critical Thinking:</strong> It's required but
                I'm also interested in polishing my critical thinking skills.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>ITIS 3135 – Front-End Web App Development:</strong>
                Required but I'm really interested in learning more about
                front-end development.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>ITSC 3155 – Software Engineering:</strong> My
                concentration.

                but I can say it's the first time I'm really enjoying math.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>PSYC 1101 – General Psychology:</strong> Required but I
                do find psychology interesting and useful.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>SPAN 3220 – Spanish for Business & International
                Trade:</strong> My minor and even though I do speak native Spanish
                I find it very cool to have a class to learn about businesses in
                Spanish.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember Me by:</strong> I'm very
            sarcastic and I like to mess around, some years ago a friend got me
            into watching the vampire diaries and now I'm rewatching it for the
            third time because I never finished it.
